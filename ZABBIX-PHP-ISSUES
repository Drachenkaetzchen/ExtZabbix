Code Size
=========

The frontend code is huge, with quite some code duplication. This is hard to maintain and even harder to extend.

API troubles
============

The API is modeled very closely to what the PHP frontend needs. It is not a generic API and cannot be easily extended
without touching every API file - if one would want to implement pagination, he would need to touch every single file
and add (=dupliate) code to make this work.
